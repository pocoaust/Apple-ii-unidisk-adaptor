# Apple 2 unidisk adaptor for 20 Pin IDC or SD Disk / floppy Emu.
Unidisk adaptor to allow 20 Pin IDC and DB19 drives to be mixed and matched

This Adaptor board allows people with Unidisk controllers with DB-19 ports to add 20 pin IDC
Device such as disk 2 drives or SD Disk and possibly floppy emu (not tested) to the drive chain
allowing them to boot from the SD Disk and use either a second 20 Pin floppy drive or a Unidisc 
as the second drive.

This has been tested with unidisk controller and 20 Pin SD Disk as drive 0 and Unidisk as Drive 1

Uses standard DB25 ports that need to be moded to DB19.
